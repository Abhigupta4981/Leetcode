The brute force solution of this problem is just iterate over all substrings and find the longest string which changes to its corresponding string in t in cost less than maxCost. That solution would be O(n^2) in time complexity and O(1) in space complexity.

We can optimize this O(n^2) to O(n) if we just maintain a window which has a left side and a right side. The let side and right side are the bounds of a substring which we are currently considering. If the cost of changing the substring in this window at any point becomes greater than the maxCost, we can just shrink the window from left side till the cost is less than maxCost. We increase the window size by moving the right side of the window. This approach works because we're doing a lot of extra work in brute force solution. The time complexity and space complexity will be O(n) and O(1) respectively in this solution.
